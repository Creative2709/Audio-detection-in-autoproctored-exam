The basic idea behind this audio part of the auto proctoring project is recording
sound from the microphone when it detects sound and converting it into text using Googleâ€™s speech 
recognition API.
  
Then texts from question paper is compared with this text. If the words of text from the candidate's voice and question paper matches. The audio and text files both are 
saved for the reference and we give warning to him. Otherwise deleted by giving warning for noise detection
